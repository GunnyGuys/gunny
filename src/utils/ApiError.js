// Operational errors represent runtime problems.
// These errors are expected in the Node.js runtime and should be dealt with
// in a proper way. This does not mean the application itself has bugs.
// It means they need to be handled properly.
// Hereâ€™s a list of common operational errors:

// failed to connect to server
// failed to resolve hostname
// invalid user input
// request timeout
// server returned a 500 response
// socket hang-up
// system is out of memory
